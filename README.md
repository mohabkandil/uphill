## Uphill - Healthcare Appointment System

A Spring Boot application for managing healthcare appointments with doctors, rooms, and time slots. Built with clean architecture, it handles appointment booking, confirmation workflows, and integrates with external services.

## Quick Start

**Prerequisites:** Java 21, Docker & Docker Compose

### Development (Local)
```bash
make dev
./mvnw spring-boot:run -Dspring.profiles.active=local
```
API: http://localhost:8080

### Docker (Full)
```bash
make run
```
API: http://localhost:8080

**Commands:**
- `make logs` - view logs
- `make down` - stop services  
- `make unit-test` - run tests

### What This System Does

This is a healthcare appointment booking system that lets patients book appointments with doctors. Here's how it works:

- **Appointment Booking**: Patients can book appointments with doctors in aspecific time slot
- **Background Processing**: When an appointment is created, the system handles confirmation steps (updating doctor calendars, reserving rooms, sending emails) in the background
- **Activity Tracking**: Everything gets logged for audit purposes
- **Security**: Uses JWT tokens for authentication, with some endpoints public for booking
- **Data Storage**: PostgreSQL for main data, Redis for caching and preventing duplicate requests

### High-Level Architecture

![Architecture](docs/diagrams/architecture.svg)

### Main Components

**Appointment Management**
- `AppointmentService`: Handles the booking flow, checks availability, and queues background tasks
- `AppointmentPersistenceService`: Saves and updates appointment data

**Background Processing (Outbox Pattern)**
- `OutboxEventService`: Creates background tasks when appointments are made
- `OutboxProcessingService`: Runs every 30 seconds to process these tasks (update doctor calendars, reserve rooms, send emails)

**Activity Logging**
- `ActivityLogPersistenceService`: Keeps track of what happened for audit trails

**API Endpoints**
- `AppointmentController`: Create and list appointments
- `AuthController`: Login/logout for admins
- `GlobalExceptionHandler`: Handles errors consistently

**Data Layer**
- JPA entities for database tables
- Spring Data repositories for database queries
- MapStruct for converting between database and domain objects

**Security**
- JWT authentication for admin endpoints
- Idempotency filter to prevent duplicate appointment requests

### API Endpoints

**Public Endpoints**
- `POST /api/appointments` - Book an appointment (no auth required)
  - Send: patientId, specialty, date, time slot
  - Get back: appointment details

**Admin Endpoints** (requires JWT token)
- `GET /api/appointments` - List all appointments with filters
- `POST /api/auth/login` - Get admin JWT token

All responses follow the same format with success/error status.

### Database Structure

**Main Tables**
- `appointments` - The core booking data
- `patients`, `doctors`, `rooms` - Basic entities
- `time_slots` - Available appointment times
- `outbox_events` - Background tasks waiting to be processed
- `activity_logs` - Audit trail of what happened

**Database Features**
- Flyway migrations handle schema changes
- Custom queries for filtering appointments
- MapStruct automatically converts between database and Java objects

**Test Data Seeding**
- **Development**: Includes sample doctors, patients, rooms, and time slots
- **Production**: Clean database with no test data
- **Testing**: Consistent test data for reliable tests

### How Background Processing Works

When someone books an appointment, the system doesn't immediately confirm it. Instead:

1. **Create Tasks**: The system creates background tasks for:
   - Updating the doctor's calendar
   - Reserving the room
   - Sending confirmation emails

2. **Process Tasks**: Every 30 seconds, a background job runs and:
   - Picks up pending tasks
   - Calls external services (doctor calendar, room reservation, email)
   - If successful: marks task as done and logs the activity
   - If failed: retries later with exponential backoff

3. **Confirm Appointment**: Once all tasks succeed, the appointment gets confirmed

### Security Setup

**Public Access**
- Anyone can book appointments (`POST /api/appointments`)
- Health check endpoints are public

**Admin Access**
- List appointments, login endpoints require JWT token
- Tokens are stateless and contain admin role
- Method-level security protects admin functions

### Preventing Duplicate Bookings

To stop people from accidentally booking the same appointment twice:

- Send an `Idempotency-Key` header with your booking request
- The system remembers this key in Redis
- If you send the same key again, you get the same response (no duplicate booking)
- Keys expire after 24 hours

### Configuration Profiles

**Local Development** (`local`)
- Uses local PostgreSQL and Redis
- Auto-creates database tables
- **Includes test data seeding** (doctors, patients, rooms, time slots)
- External services point to localhost

**Docker** (`docker`)
- Uses environment variables for database/Redis connections
- External services configured via environment
- **No test data seeding** (clean production-like environment)

**Testing** (`test`)
- Uses in-memory H2 database
- **Includes test data seeding** for consistent test data
- Debug logging enabled

### Running with Docker

**What's Included**
- PostgreSQL 16 database
- Redis 7 for caching
- The main application
- Mock external services (Node.js) for testing

**Health Checks**
- Database and Redis have health checks
- Application exposes health endpoints
- Everything starts up in the right order

### Deployment Pipeline

**Jenkins Pipeline**
- Takes parameters for AWS region, image tag, and instance count
- Builds the application and deploys to AWS
- Archives deployment scripts for later use

### Current Limitations

**Scheduling Constraints**
- Appointments must use predefined time slots (no custom durations)
- Timezone handling isn't fully implemented
- No double-booking protection beyond basic slot checking

**Security & Reliability**
- Only appointment booking is protected against duplicates
- No rate limiting on public endpoints
- Background tasks retry but don't have advanced failure handling
- Email success is assumed (no bounce tracking)

**External Dependencies**
- External services must handle duplicate calls (idempotent)
- No monitoring of external service health

### Development Setup

**Database Options**
- Use Docker Compose for PostgreSQL and Redis
- Or run them locally if you prefer

**Configuration**
- `local` profile: Auto-creates tables, uses localhost services
- `docker` profile: Uses environment variables for connections
- Background processing starts automatically

### Generating Diagrams

If you want to update the architecture diagrams:

```bash
make docs-diagrams
```

This creates SVG files in `docs/diagrams/` that show the system architecture, class relationships, and process flows.

### Potential Improvements

Here are 5 high-impact changes that would make the system more reliable and scalable:

**1. Replace Background Scheduler with Temporal**
- **Current**: `@Scheduled` polling with `OutboxProcessingService` (137 lines of complex retry logic)
- **Suggestion**: Migrate to [Temporal.io](https://temporal.io/) for robust workflow orchestration
- **Impact**: High - Eliminates polling overhead, provides built-in retry policies, visual workflow monitoring, and better reliability
- **Implementation**: 
  - **Remove**: `@Scheduled` polling, manual retry logic, outbox event persistence
  - **Add**: Simple worker that registers existing services as Temporal activities
  - **Result**: Your existing `DoctorCalendarService`, `RoomReservationService`, `EmailNotificationService` become Temporal activities with automatic retries and monitoring
- **Pseudo Code**:
  ```java
  // 1. Define what work to do (Activity)
  @ActivityInterface
  public interface AppointmentActivity {
      void updateDoctorCalendar(AppointmentEventPayload payload);
      void reserveRoom(AppointmentEventPayload payload);
      void sendEmail(AppointmentEventPayload payload);
  }
  
  // 2. Implement the work (wrap your existing services)
  @Component
  public class AppointmentActivityImpl implements AppointmentActivity {
      private final DoctorCalendarService doctorCalendarService;
      private final RoomReservationService roomReservationService;
      private final EmailNotificationService emailNotificationService;
      
      @Override
      public void updateDoctorCalendar(AppointmentEventPayload payload) {
          doctorCalendarService.updateDoctorCalendar(payload);
      }
      // ... other methods
  }
  
  // 3. Start worker (one-time setup)
  @Component
  public class TemporalWorker {
      @PostConstruct
      public void startWorker() {
          Worker worker = factory.newWorker("appointment-task-queue");
          worker.registerActivitiesImplementations(new AppointmentActivityImpl(...));
          factory.start();
      }
  }
  
  // 4. Trigger work (replace outbox creation)
  public void createAppointment() {
      AppointmentWorkflow workflow = workflowClient.newWorkflowStub(AppointmentWorkflow.class);
      WorkflowClient.start(workflow::processAppointment, appointmentId, payload);
  }
  ```

**2. Event-Driven Architecture**
- **Current**: Polling every 30 seconds to process background tasks
- **Better**: Use Kafka or AWS EventBridge for real-time event processing
- **Why**: Faster processing, better scalability, easier to add new features

**3. Better Monitoring**
- **Current**: Basic health checks and logs
- **Better**: Prometheus metrics, Grafana dashboards, structured logging
- **Why**: Catch problems before users notice, understand system performance

**4. Smart Caching**
- **Current**: Redis only used to prevent duplicate bookings
- **Better**: Cache doctors, rooms, time slots to reduce database load
- **Why**: Faster response times, less database pressure

**5. API Security & Rate Limiting**
- **Current**: No protection against abuse, basic JWT auth
- **Better**: Rate limiting, OAuth 2.0, API versioning
- **Why**: Prevent abuse, better security, easier API management
